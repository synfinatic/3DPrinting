# Celestron USB Hand Controller Cable Management

## What

I noticed on my Celestron Evolution 8" that the mini-USB connector 
on the bottom of my hand controller was loose and it was easy for
the USB cable to fall out.  I didn't want to glue the cable in place,
so I designed this bracket to connect to the bottom of the hand controller 
and make it easy to hold the USB cable in place with a rubber band.

## Print Instructions

Personally, I would print in a material with a little flex, so ABS or PETG 
is preferred.  However, PLA should work as well.

Due to the overhangs, you'll want supports.

You should be able to print a typical 3 top/bottom layers and 3 shells @ 35% infill.

## Required

* 1x Bracket
* 1x Rubber band
* Your telescope & USB cable

## Tips

1. Line up the tabs in the mount with the two small holes on the bottom of the
    hand controller and press it in.
1. Then insert your USB cable and use a rubber band to hold it in place.
