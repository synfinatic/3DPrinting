# Spool Holder NG

## What

A really nice 3D printing filament spool holder for the Rubbermaid 21 cup
storage container which is often used as a drybox.

Basically, this is designed to allow a maximum variety of spools (max width of 
78mm) while being easy to print and smooth rolling.

## Print Instructions

You will need to print two of each part (side, brace and roller) per spool holder.

ABS, PLA, PETG, whatever.  I used 3 top/bottom layers and 3 shells with 35% infil
using eSun ABS+.

## Required

Each spool holdre will require:

* 4x F695 bearings
* 4x M5 x 25mm button head bolts

## Tips

Assemble the spool holder and tighten the four bolts just so they start to compress
things and drag.  Then loosen each bolt 1/4 turn and confirm with a full spool of
filament that it rolls smoothly.
