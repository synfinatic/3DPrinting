# Celestron EdgeHD 800 Fastar Cooler

## What 

A clone of the Starizona Cool Edge for the EdgeHD 800 which is useful for 
quickly bringing your primary mirror to ambient temp.

## Print Instructions

Due to the fine threads and the tendency for ABS (and even ABS+) to shrink, 
this is a part which is best printed with PLA.  For this reason, I do not
store the mirror in the housing like the Starizona Cool Edge because I don't 
trust PLA in direct sun/heat to not fail.  I haven't tried other materials (PETG,
etc).

You should be able to print a typical 3 top/bottom layers and 3 shells @ 35% infill.

Print one (1) of:

* Top
* Bottom
* Cap
* Mirror Case

Print four (4) of:

* Fan Spacer

## Required

* 1x [Air compressor air filter](https://www.amazon.com/Filter-Replacement-compressor-STO739-03-STO739-03AU/dp/B01LZFTLLD/ref=sr_1_36)
* 1x 4020 12V fan
* 4x M4 x 70mm button head bolts
* 4x M4 x 6mm wide / 6mm tall brass heat inserts 
* 1x 5.5mmx2.1mm DC power jack [like this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N8VV78D/)


## Tips

1. Route the fan wires through the hole in the top and then solder it to the barrel jack.
1. Use a soldering iron to install the heat inserts in the top 
1. There are many specs of fan available.  I highly recommend using 
a fan with the highest static pressure (in H2O / Pa) rather than looking at raw CFM since
you need to be able to pull air through the air filter.
1. For greater air flow, you can even use a 4056 "Violence Fan" if you cut the fan spacers,
but realize these fans often require over 1Amp @ 12V.
