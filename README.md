# 3DPrinting

Collection of my 3D Printing designs.

## Why?

Because I want to share my designs and sadly, [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/synfinatic/designs)
keeps getting worse.

## What

You'll find STL and [Autodesk Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
files for the following projects.  I decided to provide the original F3D/F3Z
files because that really is the "source code" for these projects- not just the
STLs and I wish other people provided those files so I don't need to rely on
tools like [Meshmixer](https://www.meshmixer.com) to make modifications.

## General Notes

### Heat Inserts

Many of my designs utilize brass heat inserts for interfacing with bolts as they
simplify the design and provide a high quality connection which resists stripping.
I highly suggest using high quality brass heat inserts designed to resist both
twisting and pulling out like this:

Sadly, it is very hard to find distributors in the USA who carry these inserts,
but [you can find them on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001258499799.html).

## License

Once again I am being consistently inconsistent with choosing a license for my
projects.  For this project I have decided on the [GPLv2](LICENSE).  If you have
a need to use these files and don't feel like this license meets your needs,
please reach out to me and I'm happy to discuss.


## Pull Requests / Modifications

Have you made an edit to one of my projects that you'd like to chare?  Please issue
a pull request and _add_ your files to the project and update the README with details.
